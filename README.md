Hi! This is QueryLine! 
QueryLine is a plug-and-play SQL IDE that lets you run and manage SQL queries instantly, no database setup required. Its minimal, distraction-free design gives you a terminal feel for a focused time.
This project started at HackRPI 2025.

The inspiration was mainly from me. I believe SQL is an important language to learn due to the demand. But when it came to teaching it to other people, setting up can be tedious, annoying, and confusing to a begineer.
QueryLine aims to provide a easy way to write tables, queries, and perform actions without the need of setup or any distractions from other website, which gives way to the minimal feeling, the good old terminal window.
